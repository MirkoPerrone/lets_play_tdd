Check that keyboard shortcuts work (including tabbing between components)

Polish:

- Better tooltips for invalid dollar amounts

Long term:

- Cross-platform testing & support (Consider "Macify")
  - Cmd-W should close window on Mac
  - Does the DollarsTextField warning icon work properly in all look-and-feels that we use
- More realistic abstraction for capital gains tax (in StockMarketYear)


ROOT CAUSE CHECKLIST:
