Strip out exception handling from ApplicationFrame.startingBalanceField()

Format the DollarsTextField when it loses focus
 - red negative with parentheses

ApplicationFrame.startingBalanceField needs to be initialized with correct value

Require class needs an "impossible exception" method (or "not implemented")

Handle overflow/underflow in Dollars??

---
Need to handle case where starting balance is lower than cost basis--that should be illegal

Should StockMarketYear be immutable?

---
Add remaining fields so that starting conditions can be set at runtime

Check that keyboard shortcuts work (including tabbing between components)

When tabbing to DollarsTextField, should the value be selected?

Long term:

- Cross-platform testing & support (Consider "Macify")
  - Cmd-W should close window on Mac
- More realistic abstraction for capital gains tax (in StockMarketYear)
