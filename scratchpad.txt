Add remaining fields so that starting conditions can be set at runtime

Address duplication for DollarsTextField configuration in ConfigurationPanel (tests and production)

Why are first year's sales changing when cost basis is changed through UI?

Why is starting balance field not turning red when negative?

When tabbing to DollarsTextField, should the value be selected?

Why do sales change when cost basis is near starting balance value? 

Need to handle case where cost basis is larger than starting balance--that should be illegal

Check that keyboard shortcuts work (including tabbing between components)

Polish:

- Better tooltips for invalid dollar amounts

---
Long term:

- Cross-platform testing & support (Consider "Macify")
  - Cmd-W should close window on Mac
  - Does the DollarsTextField warning icon work properly in all look-and-feels that we use
- More realistic abstraction for capital gains tax (in StockMarketYear)
