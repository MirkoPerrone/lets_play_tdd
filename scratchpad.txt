Consider whether to inject icon in _InvalidDollarsTest.renderToSwingLabel

Render negative Dollars as red
 - in table
 - in text field
 
Take a second look at the way we're saying the columns are SelfRenderable in StockMarketTableModel. Too ugly?
 
Have InvalidDollars icon description reflect actual underlying problem (matching the tooltip)?

InvalidDollars should display a tooltip explaining why there's an error
 
Draw proper icon for invalid_dollars.gif

Look into whether there's a better way to manage resources like invalid_dollars.gif

ApplicationFrame.startingBalanceField needs to be initialized with correct value

Require class needs an "impossible exception" method (or "not implemented")

Handle overflow/underflow in Dollars??

---
Need to handle case where starting balance is lower than cost basis--that should be illegal

Should StockMarketYear be immutable?

---
Add remaining fields so that starting conditions can be set at runtime

Check that keyboard shortcuts work (including tabbing between components)

When tabbing to DollarsTextField, should the value be selected?

Long term:

- Cross-platform testing & support (Consider "Macify")
  - Cmd-W should close window on Mac
- More realistic abstraction for capital gains tax (in StockMarketYear)
