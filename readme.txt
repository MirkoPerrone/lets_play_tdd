Let's Play: Test-Driven Development

"Let's Play: Test-Driven Development" series is a stream-of-consciousness live recording of my successes and slip-ups as I program a real project, from scratch, using test-driven development. I'm hoping this will be an interesting view into how test-driven development works when you take it out of the classroom. As the series continues, I'm sure you'll see quite a bit of incremental design and architecture, too.

This git repository contains the source code developed during the series. For the screencasts, see http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Lets-Play/ .
